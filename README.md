# side-channel-attack-ez-crackme-solver
An automatic solver for easy crackmes using various side-channel attacks. It's
not anything serious but may be able to solve easy crackmes in highschool level
capture the flag competitions like in the example below. The idea is based on
[a blog post by Gynvael Coldwind](https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&id=763)
and Julien Voisin's article "Crackme Solving for the Lazies" from of the
magazine "Paged Out! #1".
